# Robotic-Arm-CAD-to-Control
A complete end-to-end project on designing, simulating, and controlling a 6-DOF robotic arm. Includes CAD design (SolidWorks), motion analysis, FEA (ANSYS), dynamic modeling (MATLAB/Simulink), and trajectory planning. This repository showcases mechanical design, simulation, and control integration for robotics engineering.
